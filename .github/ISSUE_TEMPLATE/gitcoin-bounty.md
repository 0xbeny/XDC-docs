## **Judging Criteria**

All submissions must contain clear and concise information with explicit instruction and images describing each step required to execute the process. An accompanying video in addition to the written content is highly desired.

All submissions will be put through an industry standard plagiarism detection tool to ensure that all submissions are the work and ideas of the person submitting for the bounty. If the plagiarism tools flags your submission you will be disqualified from participation in the bounty.

You will be provided with resources (if available) as an aid to help you get started. The sole act of submitting content for the bounty does not automatically qualify you for the bounty. Our team will review all submissions and will choose the submission whose content best fits the needs and requirements of the bounty.

Only one participant will be selected as the winner for the bounty, and they will be notified within 7 working days after the bounty has ended.
