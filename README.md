## XDC Network Overview
The XDC Network is a highly scalable, delegated proof of stake consensus network (XDPoS), with near-zero gas fees and 2 second block time. Operating the XDC Network is a global infrastructure of Masternodes that participate in network consensus. The network’s enterprise-grade architecture provides a high-performance, EVM-compatible blockchain suited to the needs of institutional use in trade finance, enterprise, and tokenization. As an open-source technology, the XDC ecosystem also thrives on a growing community of developers, contributors, and participants.
