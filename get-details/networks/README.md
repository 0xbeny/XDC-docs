# XDC Main & Test Networks Overviews

XDC main net is the production version of the XDC protocol, where real-world transactions occur. 

## **Overview of Apothem Test Network:**

Apothem is a test network for the XDC protocol, designed to allow developers and users to test the protocol's functionalities without using real funds. It is a fully functional network that replicates the XDC main net's features, but with a separate blockchain.

The Apothem test network is primarily used by developers to test their smart contracts and applications before deploying them on the XDC main net. It allows developers to test their code in a safe environment without the risk of losing funds. The test network also allows users to experiment with the XDC protocol's functionalities and learn how to use it before using the main net.

Some of the functionalities of the Apothem test network include:

1. Creating and testing smart contracts: Developers can create and test their smart contracts on the Apothem test network before deploying them on the XDC main net.
2. Testing transaction speed and fees: Users can test the transaction speed and fees of the XDC protocol on the Apothem test network, which is similar to the XDC main net.
3. Learning how to use XDC: Users can experiment with the XDC protocol's functionalities and learn how to use it before using the main net.

## Overview

In summary, the XDC main net is a production blockchain network that supports high transaction throughput and a wide range of enterprise use cases, while the Apothem test network is a separate blockchain network designed for testing the XDC protocol's functionalities without using real funds. Both networks offer developers and users the ability to experiment with the XDC protocol's functionalities and learn how to use it.
