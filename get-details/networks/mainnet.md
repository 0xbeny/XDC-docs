# Mainnet (XDPos)

## Public Networks

Users with an internet connection can easily access a public network. They can read, create, or validate transactions executed on the blockchain, and a consensus mechanism makes agreement on the state of the network possible.

**How XDC Delegated Proof of Stake works**

XDC Delegated Proof-of-Stake (XDPoS) is more efficient than PoS consensus mechanism. XDPoS uses a reputation system to achieve consensus. The Master node of the network create blocks in a round robin manner. The elected block producers or the witnesses are rewarded for validation of the transactions for the next block.

i) Block producers are elected randomly and are limited in numbers who can sign and create blocks.

ii) Block validators are the full nodes who verify that the blocks created by the block producers follow the consensus rule.

The main difference between XDPoS and PoS is in the consensus mechanism of XDPoS. The community members have more rights in governance of the network.

**pos and cons of XDC Delegated Proof of Stake**

In XDPoS consensus, only the Master Node or the block producers can create the blocks. The transactions are permitted only within the limited number of witnesses. Therefore, XDPoS helps to make processing faster, reduce cost and improve scaling. The witnesses are regularly monitored. If they are found to be malicious, i.e. try to censor transactions or double spend, the other master node can fire a witness by slashing them for the next round.

**XDC prefers XDPoS because of speed, cost and scalability**

Since XDPoS is more democratic, faster, efficient and effective to scale.\
