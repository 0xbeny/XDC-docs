# XRC Standards



## Standards Overview

The XDC community has adopted numerous standards to ensure the interoperability of projects and the composability of smart contracts and dApps.

### Token Standards

* XRC20: A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens such as virtual currencies.  XRC20 is a fork of ERC20, whose details can be found at [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)
* XRC721: A standard interface for non-fungible (unique) tokens corresponding to real-world products such as artwork or songs.  XRC721 is a fork of ERC721, whose details can be found at [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)
* XRC1155: A standard interface that enables you to create every type of asset. It allows a single contract to define and configure multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens with increased gas efficiency.  XRC1155 is a fork of ERC1155, whose details can be found at [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)
