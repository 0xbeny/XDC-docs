# XRC Standards



## Standards Overview

The XDC community has adopted numerous standards to ensure the interoperability of projects and the composability of smart contracts and dApps.

### Token Standards

* XRC20: A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens such as virtual currencies.
* XRC721: A standard interface for non-fungible (unique) tokens corresponding to real-world products such as artwork or songs.
* XRC1155: A standard interface that enables you to create every type of asset. It allows a single contract to define and configure multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens with increased gas efficiency.
