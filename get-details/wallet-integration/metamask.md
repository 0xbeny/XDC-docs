### What you will learn
This article will teach you what MetaMask is, what MetaMask is used for, and how to connect MetaMask to the XDC Network.

### What you will do

- Learn about MetaMask
- Connect MetaMask to XDC network
- Interact with XDC smart contract using MetaMask

## ðŸ“° About MetaMask

MetaMask is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains. 

MetaMask allows users to access and manage their blockchain account funds via convenient user interface.


### Why people use non-custodial wallets

To understand why people use non-custodial wallets, we first need to understand what **custodial** means. **Custodial wallet** a wallet whose private keys are held and managed by third party service (for example, an exchange). With **custodial wallet** you delegate control over your crypto holdings to another entity.

**Non-custodial** wallet is the opposite of that. With **non-custodial** wallet, only the person who has private key controls wallet's funds.

There are pros and cons that come with using non-custodial wallet:
- pros
    - You can use your funds however you want
    - No one can block your funds
- cons
    - Once you forget or lose your seed phrase or private key, your funds are lots forever
    - For every thing you do, like transfering or swapping tokens, you need to pay transaction fees. While it may not be the problem when using networks with low fees, like Polygon or XDC, fees on networks like Ethereum sometimes are very expensive

## ðŸ‘› Adding XDC mainnet and apothem testnet in MetaMask

Then fill it like below:

|                    |                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Network Name       |    XinFin                           |
| New RPC URL        |    https://rpc.xinfin.network       |
| Chain ID           |    50                               |
| Currency Symbol    |    XDC                              |
| Block Explorer URL |    https://explorer.xinfin.network/ |

To add `apothem` testnet, repeat steps with following network settings:

|                    |                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Network Name       |    Apothem                           |
| New RPC URL        |    https://rpc.apothem.network       |
| Chain ID           |    51                                |
| Currency Symbol    |    TXDC                              |
| Block Explorer URL |    https://explorer.apothem.network/ |
