# What is a Blockchain

A blockchain can be described simply through its name, but first let's take a look at its concept. Simply put, a blockchain is an open digital ledger that processes and records transactions.

Transactions on the network are processed, finalized, and recorded into groups called blocks. When a block is created, it makes a permanent record of all the transactions and state of the network. A cryptographic hash is then created to identify that block and can be used to verify its data.

The chain aspect comes from each block being connected to each other. When a new block is created, data from the previous block is verified through its cryptographic hash, connecting the new block to the previous. This process continues as each block is created, moving the state of the network forward one block at a time.

So how are transactions verified and blocks created? The blockchain is operated by a global network of nodes. These nodes are basically computers that communicate with each other, transact data on the network, and create blocks. When a new block is created, nodes ensure that data across the network is aligned and verifies the history from the previous block.
