# Wallets

XDC wallets work by utilizing public-key cryptography. When users create an XDC wallet, they are given a public key and a private key. The public key is used to receive XDC tokens, while the private key is used to send and sign transactions on the XDC Network. When a user wants to send XDC tokens to another user, they create a transaction and sign it with their private key. The transaction is then broadcast to the XDC network, where it is verified by a network of nodes. Once the transaction is verified, it is executed and recorded on the ledger.&#x20;

As an EVM-compatible network, users can enjoy the convenience of utilizing many of their favorite wallets, such as MetaMask. \
