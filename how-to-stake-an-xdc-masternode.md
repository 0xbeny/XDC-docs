# How to Stake an XDC Masternode

As an XDC masternode candidate, you are going to need the following:&#x20;

1. XDCPay or XinFin web wallet or a hardware wallet (Trezor )
2. 10,000,000 XDC (mainnet) or test XDC (Apothem testnet)
3. Your coinbase address (you can log in to your node and retrieve it from there)

Follow these steps to stake your node.
