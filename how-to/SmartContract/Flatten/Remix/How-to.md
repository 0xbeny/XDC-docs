## üì∞ About Openzeppelin

[OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications. It is a library for secure smart contract development. Build on a solid foundation of community-vetted code. It provides implementation for a number of standards like ERC20 and ERC721.

# üöÄ Setting up the development environment

[Remix](https://remix.xinfin.network/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7) is an online solidity IDE for compiling and deploying solidity code to EVM compatible blockchains. To begin working on a new smart contract, we must first create a new file in the contracts folder on the left side of the view pane.

</p>


## ‚öíÔ∏è Creating XDCPay Wallet for signing transactions

In order to get started deploying new contracts on XDC Mainnet and/or Apothem, we need to have XDCPay wallet to sign our transactions and store XDC tokens.

- First we have to install the chrome extension of [XDCPay](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdcpay/bocpokimicclpaiekenaeelehdjllofo).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190068514-7beac72f-ea99-49c9-ada7-7e88dc8cbf3e.png">
</p>

- Open the Chrome extension after it has been successfully installed.
- Agree to the Terms of Service. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190069353-3214410d-0526-41c9-9c1c-1170a10840c6.png">
</p>

- Create a new XDCPay wallet by setting up a strong password or use an existing Seed Phrase **`12 or 24-Word Mnemonic Phrase`** to recover your existing wallet here.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190121441-7b972e85-8ec0-47c2-adae-4e6c3fb01528.png">
</p>

- Keep the seed phrase safe. üö® **Do not share the seed phrase with anyone or you can risk losing your assets and/or the ownership of your smart contracts!** üö®

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190071788-c134a5bc-599a-4a6d-a481-e7cf62e75a51.png">
</p>

- Verify recovery phrase
- Your XDCPay wallet has been successfully created.


## ‚öí Adding Testnet XDC to Development Wallet

Initially, our account would be empty, and we would require some XDC tokens to initiate blockchain transactions. We would use a faucet to fill our wallet with test XDC tokens for this. These tokens are worthless in and of themselves. They are simply used to test your contracts on the testnet in order to avoid losing your real money.

- First, make a copy of your wallet address. Your wallet address would look like **`xdc057ac7de8ad6f21c7bb0dcc6a389ff9161b3b943`**. These account address are interchangeable with Ethereum network. We can access these accounts on Ethereum network by simply changing the initial `xdc` with `0x`. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190072656-cf4a819b-92e1-4eb3-948b-7c6dbc8bafc1.png">
</p>

- After that, navigate to the [XDC faucet](https://faucet.apothem.network/).
- Enter your XDC account address and request for Test XDC here.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190073022-1d893bce-5f21-494d-8e28-20cdb9b91299.png">
</p>

- If your request is approved, you will be credited with the XDC in your wallet.
- If you can't see the XDC in your wallet, make sure you're connected to the XDC Apothem Testnet or the XDC Mainnet.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190086617-07b3e4a8-4b4e-4e08-affa-97cce7b1f192.png">
</p>

- If you are currently connected to the XDC Mainnet, switch to the XDC Apothem Testnet.

# üíµ Writing our first OpenZeppelin Contract

The source code for the OpenZeppelin contract used in this tutorial is available within the tutorial. Here we will be creating an XRC721 token using the OpenZeppelin standards.

Lets start by creating the `XRC721.sol` file.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192205208-9d4cba9b-0bd8-4313-94ee-fabe376362c6.png">
</p>

And write the shell of our smart contract by writing:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract XRC721 {
    
}
```

## üíµ OpenZeppelin

Inside our contract, we would be importing the scripts from **`OpenZeppelin`** Github repository. These form the foundation for our contract which is having all the code of different functions which needs to be implemented in our contract. We are also importing the **`Counters`** from **`OpenZeppelin`** Github repository which is used to keep account of the counter of the current tokenId.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract XRC721 is ERC721 {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
    
}
```

## üíµ Methods

We need to create the `constructor` that is a function called only once when the contract is deployed, where we can parse as arguments information such as the token name and symbol. We would also create another function `createToken` which will take an address and `mint` our created `XRC721 NFT Token` to that address:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Full.sol";
// import "@openzeppelin/contracts/drafts/Counters.sol";

import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract XRC721 is ERC721 {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC721(name, symbol) {
    }

    function createToken(address tokenOwner) public returns (uint256) {
        _tokenIds.increment();
        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
        _mint(tokenOwner, newItemId);
        return newItemId;
    }
}
```

And here we have implemented everything we needed to make our token compliant with the XRC721 Standard. Of course there are more features we can implement to this contract, such as the [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol) library that replace naive mathematical operations for methods that will avoid `underflows` and `overflows`, and supply management methods such as `mint` and `burn`.

## üíµ Compiling and Deploying

Lets try compiling the `XRC721.sol` contract:

- Open the Solidity Compiler in the left side navigation pane <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190066438-b1816a19-3051-4d04-87d2-a2b1ade198f4.png" width=50px>.

- From the compiler option, select the compiler version **`v0.8.16`**.
- Choose Language as **`Solidity`**.
- Set the EVM version as the **`compiler default`**.
- Next, select **`Compile XRC721.sol`**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192210162-5894a8df-e00b-4eaa-b095-5fe91d284eab.png">
</p>


- After Successful Compilation, it will show ![alt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190067983-4451282c-348c-4872-a57d-b2e698b59cad.png)

- Once our contract has been compiled, we can deploy it to the Apothem Test Network.

For deployment on the XDC Apothem Testnet. In either case, you need to have enough funds to pay for gas fees on the address that is being used for development.

- Navigate to Deploy and Transactions ![alt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190074569-0f6cccdb-08d6-41e9-8c54-9ac9c648a283.png).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190075329-676cc9e6-170d-46f3-92eb-8d023c24d608.png">
</p>

- Choose Injected Web3 as the Environment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190122488-9f142cda-4f48-4cb0-a8b5-888695c12e18.png">
</p>

- Confirm the popup to add the account to Remix IDE now.
- Next, choose the account to which you want to deploy the contract.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190123093-c5979b6a-6026-491b-ab8f-1ae7c34b84ec.png">
</p>

- Choose the contract you want to use.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192210725-51f3a49d-9b29-4a6b-af47-9dc3c39daebb.png">
</p>

- Add Initial values regarding your token.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192211053-2daa9e0b-0e05-4752-8405-b33904cdadf1.png">
</p>

- Press the "transact" button and a popup will appear, which we must confirm in order to create the transaction for contract deployment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190075747-c7d1f7a6-2737-49ac-bd72-681a84bd95b0.png">
</p>

## üíµ Flattening our smart contract

After that we need to `flatten` out our smart contract so that it can be easily verified on our Block Explorer. 

- For that we would right click on our smart contract file and here we would see an option to `flatten` our smart contracts on the bottom of menu pane.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192693257-87ad3508-e0e1-4bd9-b32c-0ca06faacdea.jpg">
</p>

- Clicking on the flatten button will open a dialog box which we need to accept and a new icon for flatter is added to our left navigation pane.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192693831-673d676a-fddc-4da6-b39d-e4f7cfe91f6d.jpg">
</p>

- After that we move to the flattener tab and will see the option to select our smart contract which we need to flatten. Here we will select our XRC721.sol smart contract and it will give an option to save the flattened smart contract.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192696049-cb6ced5e-3f9e-415a-8ed1-09b8d0a25a91.jpg">
</p>

- After flattening, we will be having the flattened file `XRC721_flat.sol`.

This flattened code would be used further when we are verifying our token.


# üîç Verifying Contracts on the Block Explorer

Once you have successfully deployed your smart contract to the blockchain, it might be interesting to verify you contract on [XinFin Block Explorer](https://explorer.xinfin.network/).

First lets check the address our contract is deployed. Go to your wallet and get the most recent transaction details, then copy the transaction address. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190076901-179e4fac-d4e8-43c7-a657-ea525a4e3883.png">
</p>

Next, navigate to the [XDC Block explorer](https://explorer.apothem.network/) and paste the transaction hash there.  Note that if you deployed your token to Apothem testnet then you will need to navigate to the [Apothem Explorer](https://explorer.apothem.network/), and if you deployed your token to XDC mainnet then you will need to navigate to the [mainnet explorer](https://explorer.xinfin.network/).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/190076901-179e4fac-d4e8-43c7-a657-ea525a4e3883.png">
</p>

From there, we need to get the transaction details as well as the **`To Address`** where the contract is deployed. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192211779-45553699-312f-4e62-8ddf-c2e211943e39.png">
</p>

Here we have a `XRC721` contract deployed on XDC Mainnet at the `0x53bA8Cb12EaF09E6B0b671F39ac4798A6DA7d660`. This address is in the Ethereum standard but we can simply swap the `0x` prefix for `xdc` and search for our newly deployed contract on [XinFin Block Explorer](https://explorer.xinfin.network/):

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78161484/190875518-828c0061-71de-42c2-b222-0b8427852d01.png" alt="Verify 01"/>
</p>

And click in the `Verify And Publish` Option.

We will be redirected to the Contract verification page where we need to fill out:

- Contract Name: <em>XRC721</em>
- Compiler: <em> Check your</em> `Remix IDE` <em> for Compiler Version</em>
- Contract Code: <em> Just paste everything from your</em> `flattened contract` <em> file.</em>

Once everything is filled out, press Submit!

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192740081-78eebba6-f1c1-456a-8978-9fa64e4619f8.jpg" alt="Verify 02"/>
</p>

If everything is correctly filled out, your contract page on the block explorer should display a new tab called `Contract`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78161484/190875780-6223b4b0-fecc-4e79-83bc-c810c5b0351c.png" alt="Verify 03"/>
</p>

## üîç Interacting with your contract on the Block Explorer

With your XDCPay wallet, it is possible to interact with verified Smart Contracts on the [XinFin Network Block Explorer](https://explorer.xinfin.network/). You can read from, write to, or simply read the information tied to your Smart Contract on the blockchain.

For that, we would first copy the address where our contract is deployed on the network.

After that we would need to go back to the Remix IDE and paste that deployed contract address in the `At Address` button text box and click on that button.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192214035-726e991c-785c-4c72-bbeb-02cae0be0faa.png"/>
</p>

This would fetch the contract and all the functions related to our deployed contract and we can easily play around with those functions. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192214710-f4f49983-e315-472a-be7c-5d91f7c71011.png"/>
</p>

Now here we would be minting a new NFT token to our wallet. 

Here we would be passing on our `wallet address` and then we click on the `createToken` button.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192254561-f6de5540-8801-4f10-87fa-fbda5a525918.png"/>
</p>

After clicking in `createToken`, we need to confirm the transaction on the XDCPay wallet:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78161484/190876653-eb8e558b-2b09-4c0f-ad5f-a3d17a54bf30.png" alt="Verify 05"/>
</p>


We can check for the minted token by going to our XDCPay Wallet and clicking on the `Tokens` tab and click on the `Add Token` button.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192256810-4ee5dad6-f4f5-4067-ba76-a5bb9b589c81.png" alt="Verify 05"/>
</p>

Then we have to add the deployed contract address on the `Token Address` text field. This will automatically fetch the token symbol. Then click on the `Add Token` button.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192257221-be4f834f-ab55-471d-857e-d0e11836623f.png" alt="Verify 05"/>
</p>

Add our newly minted token is available in our wallet.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60708843/192257728-188f6ec3-bf3a-40ce-bcf7-a57bef1482a9.png" alt="Verify 05"/>
</p>

And we can check our successful transaction on the [Block Explorer!](https://explorer.apothem.network/txs/0xa95719657bee4d87068d3407e2c53acd9e955ad6eebe6f81d6cfcc59a42d7bb5#overview)
