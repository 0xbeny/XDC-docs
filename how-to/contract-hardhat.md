# Deploy Smart Contract using Hardhat

## Overview

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is and ethereum development environment which can be used for editing, compiling, debugging and deploying your smart contracts and dApps.

### What you will learn

This guide aims at teaching how to create a smart contract using Hardhat and deploying it on XDC Network.

### Steps

- Install and set up Hardhat
- Write and Deploy contract on XDC Network
- Check the deployment status on Xinfin scan.

## Installation Prerequisites

Metamask wallet ([Extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)) or XDC Pay Wallet ([Extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdcpay/bocpokimicclpaiekenaeelehdjllofo))

Node.js. ([Download link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

## Setup

First we need to setup our hardhat project. Open the terminal and follow these commands.

Make a folder with you project name and go to the project directory.

```bash
mkdir xdc-hardhat
cd xdc-hardhat
```

Initialize the project and install hardhat.

```bash
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

In the same directory, run

```bash
npx hardhat
```

- Select `Create a Javascript project` or `Create a Typescript project` according to your requirement.
- Specify Hardhat Project root or press enter for already specified path.
- please specify `y` for yes and `n` for no for adding a .gitignore
- Press enter for `Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox)?`

Note: If you are on windows, do install this

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

## Write Smart Contract

Now, you will have a folder structure as below

- In the contract folder, create a new file and write your contract inside it. (creating `Pizza.sol` for reference. The code for Pizza.sol is given below).

```python
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

  contract Pizza {
      uint256 public PIZZA_SIZE;
      uint256 public slices;

      constructor(uint256 _pizzaSize) {
          PIZZA_SIZE = _pizzaSize;
          slices = 0;
          slices += PIZZA_SIZE;
      }

      function eatSlice() public {
          require(slices > 0, "No Slices Left. Lets Bake a new Pizza!");
          slices -= 1;
      }

      function bakeNewPizza() public {
          require(slices == 0, "There still slices from a previous Pizza!");
          slices += PIZZA_SIZE;
      }
  }
```

- To compile the contract, write the following in the terminal

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

If this returns errors, check your contract and rectify them.

## Deployment

For writing the script to deploy the contract, create `deploy.js` in `scripts` folder, if it is already not there. Copy the following code in the `deploy.js`.

```python
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  // make sure to change the name of your contract
  const Pizza = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Pizza");
  // 4 in the bracket is to give the value to the parameter(_pizzaSize) in the constructor of the smart contract contract.
  const pizza = await Pizza.deploy(4);

  await pizza.deployed();

  console.log("pizza contract address:", pizza.address);
}

// Call the main function and catch if there is any error
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

- To add XDC testnet network to metamask.(If you are using XDC Pay you don't have to follow this step)

- To add XDC mainnet network to metamask.(If you are using XDC Pay you don't have to follow this step)

<img width="1047" alt="Screenshot 2022-09-13 at 12 35 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35517007/189842216-01c87935-4b4e-49bc-89ea-11026250dbf8.png">

## Setup .env file
>Make sure you do not push this file to github. 
- Make a `.env` at the root of the project to store the private key and network url.

```python
XINFIN_NETWORK_URL="enter-network-rpc-url-here"
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="enter-your-private-key-here"
```

- Dont know how to get your private key? Open you XDC pay wallet extension and click on the three dots on the top-left. This will open a popup.

Click on the `Export Private key` inside the popup.

Enter the password that you used while creating the account.

Copy your private key. This key will be used to sign transactions when deploying the contract through hardhat.

- To be able to import env file variables, please install `dotenv` from your terminal.

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

- Open the `hardhat.config.js` file. Now we will add the network url and private key of our wallet to this file, so that we can deploy our contract. Your `harhat.config.js` should look like this.

```python
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

const XINFIN_NETWORK_URL = process.env.XINFIN_NETWORK_URL;
const XINFIN_PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.XINFIN_PRIVATE_KEY;

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.9",
  networks: {
    xinfin: {
      url: XINFIN_NETWORK_URL,
      accounts: [XINFIN_PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

## Final Step

After writing code for the setup and contract, go back to the terminal. Make sure you are in your project directory and type:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network xinfin
```

**Voila! ðŸŽ‰ You did it.**

Copy the `contract address` or `transaction hash`(incase of testnet) and check it's deployment status on the block scan.

For testnet: [Apothem Scan](https://explorer.apothem.network/)
