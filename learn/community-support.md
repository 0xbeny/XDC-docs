# Community Support

**Community is the lifeblood and foundation of the XDC Network. Community can be anyone interacting with and contributing to the XDC Network in any way. This can be users, developers, entrepreneurs, enterprise, supporters, and anything else that contributes or builds on the network. Each community participant plays a role in a network's success, and each role has different needs from the ecosystem to successfully contribute. This page, and the rest of XDC Community documentation, will give you access to many outlets and resources that will be needed to join the XDC Network community.**&#x20;
