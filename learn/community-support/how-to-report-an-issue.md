# How to Report an Issue

This document outlines how to report an issue with the XDC Network or the core tooling around the XDC Network.  It is intended to be followed by both developers building on the network as well as users who face issues with the XDC Network.  Note that if the issue is specifically with a layer 2 project then you should begin by reaching out to that project.

## Issue Reporting Process Overview

In general the issue reporting process has two steps:

1. Raise the issue on the issue tracker of the appropriate GitHub repository
2. Elaborate on the issue with a post on [xdc.dev](https://www.xdc.dev/)

### Raising an Issue on GitHub

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2.  Under your repository name, click  **Issues**.

6. If you're a project maintainer, you can [assign the issue to someone](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users), [add it to a project board](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board/#adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board-from-the-sidebar), [associate it with a milestone](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/associating-milestones-with-issues-and-pull-requests), or [apply a label](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests).
7. When you're finished, click **Submit new issue**.

### Creating a Post on XDC.dev

1.  On [xdc.dev](https://www.xdc.dev/) (after having created an account) click on the "Create Post" button in the upper right hand corner.

    Within the body of the post be sure to provide as much context as possible, including screenshots that help illustrate the issue.  The post on xdc.dev will raise the issue with XDC Developer Community and also give you a way to provide detailed information to the developers who will be working on resolving your issue.
3. As an example of a post describing an issue please reference: [https://www.xdc.dev/menezesphill/ethereum-compatible-rpc-endpoint-on-apothem-rejecting-remote-calls-jel](https://www.xdc.dev/menezesphill/ethereum-compatible-rpc-endpoint-on-apothem-rejecting-remote-calls-jel)
4. Once your post is complete, hit the "Publish" button on the bottom left hand corner of the screen to make the post live.
5.  You can use the comments section below your post to engage with developers to answer questions or provide further feedback on your issue.
