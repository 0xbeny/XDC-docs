# How to Deploy Your First Smart Contract on the XDC Network Using Hardhat and TypeScript

## Overview

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is an ethereum development environment which can be used for editing, compiling, debugging and deploying your smart contracts and dApps.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly typed programming language that builds on TypeScript.

### What you will learn

This guide aims at teaching how to create a smart contract using Hardhat with TypeScript and deploying it on XDC Network.

### Steps

* Install and set up Hardhat
* Write and Deploy contract on XDC Network
* Check the deployment status on Xinfin scan.

## Installation Prerequisites

Metamask wallet ([Extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)) or XDC Pay Wallet ([Extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdcpay/bocpokimicclpaiekenaeelehdjllofo))

Node.js. ([Download link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

## Setup

First we need to setup our hardhat project. Open the terminal and follow these commands.

Make a folder with you project name and go to the project directory.

```bash
mkdir xdc-hardhat && cd xdc-hardhat
```

Initialize the project with hardhat.

```bash
npx hardhat
```

![Hardhat init](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14329097/192101554-da367351-53d9-498f-a533-94766022eff2.png)

* Select `Create a Typescript project` with `â†“` and `Enter`.
* Specify Hardhat Project root or press enter for already specified path.
* please specify `y` for yes and `n` for no for adding a `.gitignore` file.
* Press `Enter` for `Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox)?`

## Write Smart Contract

Now, you will have a folder structure as below

* In the contract folder, create a new file and write your contract inside it. (creating `Pizza.sol` for reference. The code for Pizza.sol is given below).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Pizza {
    uint256 public PIZZA_SIZE;
    uint256 public slices;

    constructor(uint256 _pizzaSize) {
        PIZZA_SIZE = _pizzaSize;
        slices = 0;
        slices += PIZZA_SIZE;
    }

    function eatSlice() public {
        require(slices > 0, "No Slices Left. Lets Bake a new Pizza!");
        slices -= 1;
    }

    function bakeNewPizza() public {
        require(slices == 0, "There still slices from a previous Pizza!");
        slices += PIZZA_SIZE;
    }
}
```

* To compile the contract, write the following in the terminal

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

If this returns errors, check your contract and rectify them.

## Deployment

For writing the script to deploy the contract, create `deploy.ts` in `scripts` folder, if it is not already there. Copy the following code in the `deploy.ts`.

```ts
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

async function main() {
  // make sure to change the name of your contract
  const Pizza = await ethers.getContractFactory("Pizza");
  // 4 in the bracket is to give the value to the parameter(_pizzaSize) in the constructor of the smart contract contract.
  const myContract = await Pizza.deploy(4);

  await myContract.deployed();

  console.log("pizza contract address:", myContract.address);
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

* To add XDC testnet network to metamask.(If you are using XDC Pay you don't have to follow this step)

* To add XDC mainnet network to metamask.(If you are using XDC Pay you don't have to follow this step)

## Setup .env file

> Make sure you do not push this file to github.

* Make a `.env` at the root of the project to store the private key and network url.

```python
XINFIN_NETWORK_URL="enter-network-rpc-url-here"
XINFIN_PRIVATE_KEY="enter-your-private-key-here"
```

Depending on which network (Apothem or XinFin) you are deploying to you will need to use one of these Network URL's:

```python
XINFIN_NETWORK_URL=https://erpc.xinfin.network
APOTHEM_NETWORK_URL=https://erpc.apothem.network
```

* Dont know how to get your private key? Open you XDC pay wallet extension and click on the three dots on the top-left. This will open a popup. ![Screenshot 2022-09-18 at 12 27 44 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35517007/190872826-b3437164-e6a8-487d-91c7-4a1d85d341d1.png)

Click on the `Export Private key` inside the popup.

Enter the password that you used while creating the account.

Copy your private key. This key will be used to sign transactions when deploying the contract through hardhat.

![Screenshot 2022-09-18 at 12 31 35 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35517007/190872961-7ffb8329-2601-4346-bbb0-7a4ff38fd5f8.png)

* To be able to import env file variables, please install `dotenv` from your terminal.

```bash
npm install --save-dev dotenv
```

* Open the `hardhat.config.ts` file. Now we will add the network url and private key of our wallet to this file, so that we can deploy our contract. Your `harhat.config.ts` should look like this.

```ts
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.17",
  networks: {
    xinfin: {
      url: process.env.XINFIN_NETWORK_URL,
      accounts: [process.env.XINFIN_PRIVATE_KEY!]
    }
  }
};

export default config;
```

## Final Step

After writing code for the setup and contract, go back to the terminal. Make sure you are in your project directory and type:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network xinfin
```

**Voila! ðŸŽ‰ You did it.**

Copy the `contract address` or `transaction hash` (in case of testnet) and check it's deployment status on the block scan.

For mainnet: [XinFin Scan](https://explorer.xinfin.network/) For testnet: [Apothem Scan](https://explorer.apothem.network/)
