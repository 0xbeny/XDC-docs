# Solidity

Solidity is a programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a high-level language similar to JavaScript and is designed to be easy to learn and use. Solidity supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, making it suitable for developing complex decentralized applications.

Solidity is used to write the smart contracts that power decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts define the rules and logic of the application, such as how tokens are distributed, how users can interact with the application, and how data is stored and managed.

Developers use Solidity to write the code for these contracts, which are then compiled into bytecode and deployed to the XDC network on any other EVM compatible network. Once deployed, the contracts can be interacted with by users and other contracts on the blockchain, enabling the decentralized functionality of the dapp.
